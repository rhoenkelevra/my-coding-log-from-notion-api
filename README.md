# my-coding-log-from-notion-api

In this project I am trying to use the new Notion API (beta) to fetch a collection of logs about learning to code. These logs for now are not my real logs.
This app is based on the [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JdP-S3crt8) tutorial about the Notion API. The UI implementation for now is from the video, which I intend to change later to practice my css skills. 

In this project I practiced:
- API calls
- async / await
- Vanilla JS DOM manipulation
- Use dotenv library
- Express server
